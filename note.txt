first we run tsc --init , to make the tsconfig.json file then  we 
open the tsconfig.json to change teh es version fron 2016 to 2022
and we changed 
"noEmitOnError" to  true, so that the ts code does not compiles into js code if we have wrote wrong ts code 
"outDir" to  "./dist",     an output folder for all emitted files
"rootDir": "./src",                                  /* Specify the root folder within your source files. */

and make sure the tsconfid, src,dist are under the root folder .
